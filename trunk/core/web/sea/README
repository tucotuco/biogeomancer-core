This is cleaned up version of the application/data used at the MapServer User Meeting in
the "Advanced Interfaces" workshop.

It is intended to take users from a basic MapServer web application to a full-featured
DHTML-based frontend. It demonstrates topic like URL-based configuration, virtual images
for panning, frames and DHTML.

To install:

  - unpack workshop.zip someplace in your web tree
  - edit "index.html" to reflect your configuration (there are HTML comments marking the 
    sections that need to be changed)
  - point your browser at index.html and it should work

Requirements:

  - MapServer version 4.0, basic build

Questions and/or comments should be sent to Stephen Lime, <steve.lime@dnr.state.mn.us>.
