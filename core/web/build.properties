  These properties generally define file and directory names (or paths) that
  affect where the build process stores its outputs.

  app.name             Base name of this application, used to
                       construct filenames and directories.
                       Defaults to "myapp".
  
  app.path             Context path to which this application should be
                       deployed (defaults to "/" plus the value of the
                       "app.name" property).

  app.version          Version number of this iteration of the application.

  build.home           The directory into which the "prepare" and
                       "compile" targets will generate their output.
                       Defaults to "build".

  catalina.home        The directory in which you have installed
                       a binary distribution of Tomcat 5.  This will
                       be used by the "deploy" target.

  dist.home            The name of the base directory in which
                       distribution files are created.
                       Defaults to "dist".

  manager.password     The login password of a user that is assigned the
                       "manager" role (so that he or she can execute
                       commands via the "/manager" web application)

  manager.url          The URL of the "/manager" web application on the
                       Tomcat installation to which we will deploy web
                       applications and web services.

  manager.username     The login username of a user that is assigned the
                       "manager" role (so that he or she can execute
                       commands via the "/manager" web application)

<!--  ==================== Compilation Control Options ==================== -->

<!--

  These properties control option settings on the Javac compiler when it
  is invoked using the <javac> task.

  compile.debug        Should compilation include the debug option?

  compile.deprecation  Should compilation include the deprecation option?

  compile.optimize     Should compilation include the optimize option?

-->

compile.debug="true"
compile.deprecation="false"
compile.optimize="true"

<!-- ==================== External Dependencies =========================== -->
<!--
  
  Use property values to define the locations of external JAR files on which
  your application will depend.  In general, these values will be used for
  two purposes:
  * Inclusion on the classpath that is passed to the Javac compiler
  * Being copied into the "/WEB-INF/lib" directory during execution
    of the "deploy" target.

  Because we will automatically include all of the Java classes that Tomcat 5
  exposes to web applications, we will not need to explicitly list any of those
  dependencies.  You only need to worry about external dependencies for JAR
  files that you are going to include inside your "/WEB-INF/lib" directory.

  <property name="foo.jar"
           value="/path/to/foo.jar"/>
