## Overview ##
The Java BioGeomancer Core API is used for georeferencing localities. For example:

  * 5 Miles West of Berkeley
  * Between Stuttgart and Munich
  * 17 KM Northeast of Singapore
  * 2 KM south of St. Petersburg, Russia
  * 5 KM east of Madagascar

To see BioGeomancer in action, try the [BioGeomancer Workbench](http://bg.berkeley.edu/latest) web application.

The API is a primary deliverable of the [BioGeomancer Project](http://biogeomancer.org) which was managed by the University of California at Berkeley, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and implemented by [several institutions worldwide](http://biogeomancer.org/about.html).
