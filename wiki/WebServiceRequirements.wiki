= Objective =

To create a REST based georeferencing web service backed by the BioGeomancer API within the next 3 months.  

= Scope =

The web service will accept a locality and a higher geography and will return an XML document describing each georeference object generated by the BioGeomancer API.

= Requirements =

The web service will be implemented using Java and the BioGeomancer API. It will be deployed as a WAR file in Apache Tomcat. All code will be managed using the Subversion repository at biogeomancer-core.googlecode.com/source. The following code style will be used: [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/makinggwtbetter.html#codestyle code style].

= Boundaries =

The project does not include supporting other protocols such as SOAP or RPC. Any user interface will be developed by another team.

= Deliverables =

The deliverables for this project are:
  # REST georeferencing web service WAR file
  # Web service requirements documentation
  # Web service design documentation
