= BioGeomancer Web Service Project =

== Objective ==

To create a REST based georeferencing web service backed by the BioGeomancer API within the next 3 months.  

== Scope ==

The web service will accept a locality and a higher geography and will return an XML document describing each georeference object generated by the BioGeomancer API.

== Requirements ==

The web service will be implemented using Java and the BioGeomancer API. It will be deployed as a WAR file in Apache Tomcat. All code will be managed using the Subversion repository at biogeomancer-core.googlecode.com/source. The following code style will be used: [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/makinggwtbetter.html#codestyle code style]. The web service will log all errors and requests to a file on the server.

== Boundaries ==

The project does not include supporting other protocols such as SOAP or RPC. Any user interface will be developed by another team.

== Deliverables ==

The deliverables for this project are:
  # REST georeferencing web service WAR file
  # Web service requirements documentation
  # Web service design documentation

== Acceptance Criteria ==

The web service will be deployed on a server with several other applications. It must not dominate server resources such as RAM and CPU. Any defects in final deliverable must be approved by all stakeholders.

== Constraints ==

There is no formal funding source for this project. 

== Assumptions ==

Developing the web service does not require changes to the BioGeomancer API codebase.

== Organization ==

The team will start with a Project Manager and 3 programmers from U.C. Berkeley and the University of Kansas.
